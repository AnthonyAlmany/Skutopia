There are quite a few improvements intentionally left out of the codebase for you to write about. This is your chance to show off your thinking and we would love to hear your thoughts around making this a production system. The improvements could be wide ranging touching on, for example, the code, monitoring and observability, cicd, infra, system design, security, and beyond.

<Write about your suggested improvements here. Remember, software engineering is about communicating with people more than it is about writing instructions for machines>
